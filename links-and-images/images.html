    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>
      This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for
      <a href="index.html">links</a> and
      <a href="misc/extras.html">useful extras</a>.

    <h2>JPG</h2>
    <p>
      JPG images are good for photos and images with lots of gradients in them
    </p>
    <p>
      They are designed to handle large color palettes without exorbitantly
      increasing file size.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble" />
    <h2>GIF</h2>
    <p>GIFS are good for animations</p>
    <p>
      GIFS are the go-to option for simple animation but the trade off is that
      they're somewhat limited in terms of color palette.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="A dancing mochi ball" />
    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
    <p>
      PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated. They deal with
      opacity and don't have color palette limitations but can produce larger
      file size for an quivalent JPG file.

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
    <p>
      SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to
      any diemsnion without loss of quality.
